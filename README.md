# Code accompanying the data analysis performed in the paper "Homeobox and Polycomb target gene methylation in human solid tumors"
Relevant code for epigenetic biomarker identification used for this publication: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-64569-5

Please see the paper (DOI above) for specifics, including the list of homeobox genes used, the genome assemblies, etc. 

The order in which the scripts should be run in is specified by their numerical order. 

The TCGA BRCA dataset has been used as an example, but the study used 16 datasets from TCGA

All visualization was performed in R using ggplot, as described in the paper.
