# Code accompanying the data analysis performed in the paper "Homeobox and Polycomb target gene methylation in human solid tumors"
Relevant code for epigenetic biomarker identification used for this publication: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-64569-5

Please see the paper (DOI above) for specifics, including the list of homeobox genes used, the genome assemblies, etc. 

The order in which the section shoudl be run is:

1. BRCA_DMR_Analysis
2. Summary
3. Homeobox_filter
4. Homeobox_DMR_overlap

The TCGA BRCA dataset has been used as an example, but the study used 16 datasets from TCGA

All visualization was performed in R using ggplot, as described in the paper.
